# Python_OOP
  - This repo is an example of OOP using Python. I use it at my work to validate environment health. I've removed any company specific information from the files.
  - The connections class will initialize the api endpoint I need for the calls. It will also set a unique identifier that is required for each call. 
  - The core calls class holds the api calls I make to validate the system health. 
  - The main file is where I initialize each class and call the execute_core_calls command which executes the calls held in the core calls class.
